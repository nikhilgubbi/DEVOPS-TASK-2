So here is my task 2 given by Vimal sir under DevOps training I tried to do as much as I can.
problem statement is:-
1. Create container image that’s has Jenkins installed  using dockerfile 
2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.
3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and  job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins 
4.  Job1 : Pull the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.
5.  Job2 : By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter install image container to deploy code ( eg. If code is of  PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed ).
6. Job3 : Test your app if it  is working or not.
7. Job4 : if app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages.
8. Create One extra job job5 for monitor : If container where app is running. fails due to any reason then this job should automatically start the container again.
